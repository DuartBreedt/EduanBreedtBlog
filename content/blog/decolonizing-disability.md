>Slated for death or slated for debilitation—both are forms of the racialization of individuals and populations that 
liberal (disability) rights frameworks, advocating for social accommodation, access, acceptance, pride, and empowerment, 
are unable to account for, much less disrupt - Jasbir Puar <cite>[^1]</cite>   

This blog was originally authored by Erin Tichenor, Mica Pabia, and Eduan Breedt as an oral presentation delivered at the 
University of Alberta, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine Symposium 2025. 

We want to be clear that what we are sharing is our interpretations of and reflections on the work of scholars such as 
Jasbir Puar[^1][^2], Chris Bell[^3], Lou Tam[^4][^5], Nirmala Erevelles[^6], Helen Meekosha[^7], Rita Giacaman[^8][^9], 
Julie Livingston[^10], Raewyn Connell[^11], Rachel Gorman[^12][^13][^14], Kharnita Mohamed[^15], Desiree Valentine [^16][^17],
Femi Eromosele[^18], Alison Kafer and Eunjung Kim[^19] and many others not mentioned here. Our reading of these scholars 
who write on race, disability, madness, and colonialism, will necessarily be limited by our own positionalities, perspectives, 
and experiences.   

### Critical Disability Studies in Rehabilitation Science

Rehabilitation, as a field, has long been ableist, insisting on ‘fixing’ or normalizing disabled people toward European humanist 
notions of the ‘ideal’ human[^20][^21][^22]. Critical disability studies intervenes in these issues by affirming disability as a 
valuable aspect of human diversity, empowering disabled people, and shifting attention away from individual impairments toward 
the ways society produces disability through pathologization, discrimination, and inaccessible environments [^23]. This means that 
disability is more of a social construct, rather than evidence of inherent pathology or inferiority. For Critical Disability Studies, 
we don’t necessarily need to ‘fix’ or’ get rid’ of disability, but need access, inclusion, and accommodation - the removal of societal 
barriers to disabled people’s participation in society and societal institutions.

These are important points and although more rehabilitation scholars ought to incorporate Critical Disability Studies perspectives 
into their work, we would like to centre some critiques and hesitations of mainstream Critical Disability Studies and activism  as 
offered by racialized disability scholars and those writing about or within the ‘Global South’. Our aim is to synthesize these concerns 
and invite us all to engage with this work in our own scholarship

### Shortcomings of Critical Disability Studies
Helen Meekosha[^7] highlights that although 80% of the world's disabled population live in the ‘Global South,’ the majority of critical 
disability scholarship comes from white academics in the ‘Global North,’ which often privilege Western understandings of disability, impairment, 
and ableism. Helen Meekosha (2011)[^7] challenges Critical Disability Studies’ “universalizing tendencies” and its “lack of geopolitical 
specificity” (p. 681). She highlights that many marginalized people around the world do not necessarily identify or resonate with Western 
notions of being disabled. For instance, states and medical institutions might not even count their experiences as disabilities deserving of
rights (see also Gunaratnum 2021[^24]; Puar 2017[^1]). Second, disability rights themselves don’t benefit people equally. For example, 
Rachel Gorman (2013)[^13] studied how it’s mostly White students who seek and are granted accommodations in universities. Third, many people 
do not necessarily want to be included into harmful systems that perpetuate colonial and racial capitalist violence - such as corporations 
and the military. We’ll unpack these points more as we go.

### Racial, colonial violence & disability
If we dig a bit deeper, we start to see that there are fundamental issues with the framing of disability itself and the idea that it can 
be separated from racism and colonialism. The first issue is that we often hear the phrase that ableism is “like” racism or colonialism - 
just another form of discrimination or distinct aspect of intersectionality that is simply added on top of race. This misses the ways that 
racism, colonialism, and ableism have emerged together. Racism has historically constructed racialized people as ‘defective,’ ‘inferior,’ or 
‘in need of control’ — these logics deeply inform how disability is conceptualized.[^1][^4][^19]

The next big issue is how the Western ideas of disability activism can obscure colonial violence and prop up the systems that perpetuate it. 
As Jasbir Puar (2017:73) writes, it is a “function of racial, class, and locational privilege” to focus the social model on issues like 
exclusionary infrastructure, without including how social systems like war, genocide, forced migration, colonial occupation, labor exploitation, 
environmental racism, and police brutality both impair and disable people. Ironically, even though corporations and colonial states say they 
promote disability empowerment and inclusion,  they are also the ones  consistently debilitating people through the violences we just mentioned. 
Under these conditions, we can’t universally say that disability is just diversity or that “disability is a resource, not a restriction,” 
(Garland-Thompsonn 20xx:?),  when it often does result from systemic violence and disproportionately affects marginalized populations.


There is no doubt that the concept of the body-as-machine played a pivotal role in legitimizing physiotherapy as 
a provider of rehabilitation services and shaped the profession's identity[^2].  

Implicit in the assumptions of the body-as-machine is the notion that bodies are made up of mechanical parts, 
mimicking the machines of the industrial revolution[^2][^3][^4]. Like a mechanical machine, body parts 'wear out' 
with use  - especially when different parts are 'misaligned' from the corporeal norm - which then require repairing 
or fixing by an ‘expert’ clinician.  

Many have rightly argued that the concept of the body-as-machine was disciplinary, and had emerged from what Michel 
Foucault calls a ‘disciplinary society’[^5]. To oversimplify the issue, this means the body-as-machine would use a 
binary of normal/abnormal to discipline bodies to adhere to an “Ideal” norm, where the norm was deemed the most healthy[^6]. 
This could include normal posture, normal range of motion, normal muscle function, normal gait[^7].  

Professor David Nicholls has done an excellent job at tracing this history, writing that “[t]he body-as-machine became 
a powerful [concept], particularly after the Industrial Revolution, when it was thought that it might apply not only 
to the function of various bodies, but to the machinery of production that had become necessary to fuel the growth of 
an economy.”[^2]      

Therefore, conceptualizing the body as a mechanical machine not only disciplined bodies to adhere to an 'Ideal norm,' 
but also enabled nation states to effectively govern their growing populations, their individual freedoms, labour, and 
health while also simultaneously fueling the industrial capitalist machine[^2][^3]. After all, the healthier a population, 
the more economically productive and valuable they are. For example, during and after World War 1, physiotherapy became 
integral in recapacitating debilitated and disposable surplus populations to the machinery of economic production, making 
them valuable again - either by returning injured soldiers to the frontlines of various wars as biological fodder for the 
globalization and expansion of Euro-American empire, or by returning bodies to work, to physically labor in factories so 
the nation state could meet the demands of the rapidly expanding global market[^2][^3][^8]. Bodies that cannot labor are surplus 
– a drain on the nation[^8]. Physiotherapy and the body-as-machine was (and arguably still is) instrumentalized to manage 
populations, their health, and physical ability, for the sake of nation-states, functioning as a conduit of societal and 
political power[^2].

Physiotherapist 'expertise' in disciplining, normalizing, and 'correcting' the 'broken' or pathological' body, and producing 
'healthy,' disciplined bodies, was instrumental in helping physiotherapy gain social, and political legitimacy in the lead up 
to World War 1, significantly shaping the profession's identity[^2][^3][^4][^8]. Understandably, then, the concept is one which 
physiotherapists find very hard to part with. Today, however, literature retrospectively scrutinizing the profession's 
biomechanical past and the harms it has caused is increasing, making it easier than ever to justify abandoning it.  

Some scholars have highlighted that the assumption of the body as fragile and in need of 'Ideal' alignment and functioning to 
be healthy causes worse health outcomes[^9][^10][^11]. Others argue that the reductionist search for 'objective' lesions or 
abnormalities has rendered the subject and their ‘lived’ experience an unwanted appendage to the physical lesion under 
investigation[^12][^13]. Furthermore, the corporeal norm has long been criticized for its European humanist, hetero-patriarchal, 
and ableist presuppositions that render those that do not fit this norm undesirable and pathological[^2][^7][^14]. And, of course, 
there exists no shortage of online discourse on the matter with many popular physiotherapists insisting “the body is not a machine!”

However, like God, we should not assume that we were disillusioned by the body-as-machine and that we now 'better' understand how 
bodies work (although this is true in part). Rather, we should understand the body-as-machine as a real thing which played a crucial role 
in shaping physiotherapy on a material level. It assembled the kinds of instruments, interventions, words, and behaviours
physiotherapists would adopt. Today, however, a different assemblage has, or is in the process of, replacing the body-as-machine.

### A New Era

Just as the age of enlightenment and its principles of rationalism and scientific knowledge replaced God as a measure of Truth, if you 
read the works of Gilles Deleuze[^15], Jasbir Puar[^16], Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri[^17], and even Michel Foucault[^18] you would be quick 
to notice that they argue that disciplinary societies (from which the body-as-machine emerged) is being replaced. Similarly, we are 
quite obviously no longer gripped by industrial capitalism. We have moved on to what some have called late-stage capitalism, neoliberal 
capitalism, surveillance capitalism, algorithmic capitalism, or some version thereof. 

If the body-as-machine arose from a disciplinary society and industrial capitalism, what concept of the body does physiotherapy currently 
operate with in our current society and political economy? How is our concept of the body changing? What alternatives are replacing the 
body-as-machine?

If the body-as-machine mimicked the simple machines of the industrial revolution, does the new concept of the body mimic today's machines such as computers, the internet, and artificial intelligence - modulation machines?[^17]

If clinicians who deploy the body-as-machine could be heard saying things like “your joints wear and tear,” “your back pain is likely due to 
poor joint alignment and poor posture,” and “muscle imbalance is causing muscle pain," then what are clinicians saying today? What discourses 
are gaining popularity and what ends are these discourses serving?[^19] And if the body-as-machine served state and corporate interests during 
the industrial era, might these new discourse be serving similar ends just in a contemporary [neoliberal](https://eduanbreedt.com/blog/neoliberalism-and-physiotherapy/) socio-political climate?

It has become overwhelmingly clear to me over the last few years that those who (rightfully) criticize the body-as-machine propose instead some 
version of a holistic person-centred, biopsychosocial, embodied, lived alternative - one that replaces the clinician as the authority and expert 
with the patient as the authority and expert of their own body. Might this be a symptom of the passage from the body-as-machine to a new concept 
of the body - one that also serves corporate and state interests, just in new ways?

For those who contend that “This is not like the body-as-machine. This has proven to improve the lives of our patients. Plus how bad can being 
holistic and person-centred be?” I would like to remind you that missionaries had nothing but good intentions for those whom they 'saved.' Similarly, our biomechanical forefathers (and mothers) had nothing but ‘good intentions’ for those who they 'fixed,' believing themselves to be serving their society and helping people regain their health. 

It is my opinion that we are currently, willfully and enthusiastically, plummeting into the same well-intentioned abyss, where presumed benevolence 
cloaks the larger socio-political systems we and our profession are serving.

Is it not our responsibility to avoid the mistakes of our predecessors and be “harsh and deceptive to what [we] love?”[^20]. To pay attention to, 
and scrutinize, what presents itself as common sense? “It's up to [us] to discover what [we're] being made to serve, just as [our] elders discovered, 
not without difficulty, the telos of the disciplines”[^15]. I wonder if we’ll look back in a few years and scrutinize the new concept of the body - 
maybe we’ll call it the body-as-modulation[^15][^16].
