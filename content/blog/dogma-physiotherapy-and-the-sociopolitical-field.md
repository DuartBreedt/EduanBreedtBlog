As an aspiring clinician, I felt pressured to become familiar with the field’s foundational concepts, and to be a 
skilled follower of its basic tenets. Much like converting to a new religion, physiotherapy calls us to ‘abandon a 
corrupt set of beliefs … and then with the force of revelatory discovery, to be moved into the the light of truth’ 
[^1] We are stripped naked and baptised in the presuppositions of our profession, becoming One with those who came 
before us, knowing what they know so that we can pick up the baton and “further the profession.” We quickly 
specialise, settle on an identity within physiotherapy, define our clinical practices, and find our guru(s). We find 
ourselves thrust into the epicenter of the sociopolitical field without the chance to reckon with the structure of it. 
The sociopolitical field in which physiotherapy has come to find power and credibility is made imperceptible.

The sociopolitical field is seldom adequately addressed in healthcare education - both clinically and practically. While 
the emphasis on the lived phenomenological aspects of health have gained prominence, there still exists an epidemic of 
widespread neglect of the sociopolitical field. To consider and critique the sociopolitical is to critique the system 
in which our profession is nested. Neglecting the sociopolitical is partly intentional and partly a symptom of the 
system itself. A medical profession which brings the messy entrails of the sociopolitical (neoliberal / capitalist) 
field to our conscious awareness risks its own destruction. That which no longer serves the agenda of the sociopolitical 
system, a profession which escapes the territory of the major, is always at risk of being recaptured, destroyed, and 
reabsorbed.

It is as though our noses are pressed up against a painting, accepting the belief that the closer we are the more 
clearly we can see. Our time is occupied by discerning the different shades of yellow right in front of our eyes. When 
we attempt to step a way, making some space between ourselves and what we are seeing, we are pushed back into it, 
encouraged to look even closer.

Physiotherapy’s preoccupation with (for the most part) the biological and minor aspects of the psychological, limits our perspective. The 
passive adoption of the profession’s presuppositions with no critical eye for the system it serves, conforming to 
predominant thought, puts us at risk of only being able to think of the profession in a limited number of ways. It 
is this unreflective adoption of seemingly self-evident presuppositions and clinical dogmas, that, transferred to us 
through recognition, stifles or even halts thought. We become one of the many; our ability to recognise and repeat; 
recognise and regurgitate, allows us entry. Entry into a world - or a profession - in which we can no longer bring 
forth anything new. Physiotherapy has formed, what french philosopher Gilles Deleuze would call, its own Dogmatic 
Image of Thought which has stopped us from thinking. 

>There is a more or less implicit, tacit or presupposed images of thought which determines our goals when we try 
to think.
> — <cite>Deleuze 1995[^2]</cite>

But before we address the sociopolitical field we first need to untangle our presuppositions on which the 
sociopolitical field stands. To do this requires us to consider how we use recognition to construct thought.  

### Recognition
For Gilles Deleuze, thinking has primarily been considered an exercise of recognition, defined as “the harmonious 
exercise of all the faculties upon a supposed same object.” [^2] A thinker recognizes an object when 
they use their faculties of memory, perception, understanding, and judgment in a concordant manner upon the object. 
“Ah-ha yes of course, that makes sense” is the comfortable feeling that we experience when we see a connection that 
strikes us as right. Something “clicks,” we say [^1]. 

Recognition, however, isn’t the full picture. In order to recognize, we need what Deleuze refers to as representation. 
To be able to “recognize” a thing, it needs to represent the thing in thought. I.e, to recognize a chair, I need some 
understanding of the representational category (or ‘blueprint’) of chairs and its place within our current social 
linguistic system. Certain essential characteristics help us recognize the object. A rudimentary example might be that 
a chair has four legs, a place to sit, and it often has a backrest and/or arm rests. This enables us to come across an 
object we may have not ever seen before, but to still recognize it as a chair.

This representational model of thinking is a powerful ‘construction’ that is practically and theoretically useful, 
bringing about some sense and order to the world. Large parts of our daily life are taken up by acts of recognition, 
as we seek to understand or “get” or perceive what is presented to us. I can see a tree I have never seen before and 
with a high level of certainty know that it is a tree. When I come across a building with a big red cross and ambulances, 
I recognize it is a hospital. When I see someone running next to the road, I recognize he is not running from or after 
something but rather within our particular social context he is exercising. Recognition is valuable within healthcare; 
we try to recognize a client’s clinical presentation, diagnosis, best treatment pathway, psychological barriers, and so on.

In the same way, to be able to recognize an achilles tendinopathy, we need to determine through our perception if it has 
the requisite essential features of a tendinopathy to determine if it reflects our representational category for an achilles 
tendinopathy. This is based on our memory of previous examples of this condition. This means we need some understanding of 
the representational category of achilles tendinopathies within our healthcare system of meaning. If recognized, we will 
feel the satisfying feeling of  “aha! I know what is going on here” surge up within us. The client’s variety of presenting 
features makes sense to us. We can deploy the category, which enables us to attend to them in the manner expected of us. 

**Crucially, this is what we begin to believe is emblematic of what it means to ‘think’ as a physiotherapist. “I am a good 
thinker because I could recognize and categorize what was presented to me”.**

For Deleuze, the trouble comes when these representational categories and systems of meaning come to be understood as 
self-evident categories which simply ‘name’ a reality. In other words, they become Dogma and sustain a conformist image 
of thought. When we do not critically examine the underlying categories of representation, we consider predominant ideas, 
theories, principles, or values as “Reality” or “Truths” that are merely waiting to be “discovered.” The moment we think 
of something as understood, traditional, we are limited in thinking of it in that way. We are trapped in the conformist 
system of thinking and nothing novel can be thought. 

When we see our presuppositions as “obvious” or “something everyone knows,” even if implicitly, we imply that they are 
set in stone, immovable, uncontestable. We imply that there exists something about the concept that does not merit the 
scrutiny we would normally apply. Deleuze calls this type of thought “common sense.” For him, this does not constitute 
real thought, only the dogmatic image of thought. This desperate need to cling to “common sense” and use it as the best 
point of departure for inquiry, is problematic for real inquiry.

Presuppositions will have the appearance of “everybody knows, no one can deny that…” This rhetoric has been used with 
countless presupposed beliefs within the profession including the belief that joints become painful due to accumulated 
wear and tear over time [^3], degenerative changes in the spine found on radiological imaging indicate the site 
of a client’s pain [^4][^5], back pain is due to non-ideal posture [^6][^7][^8], scapula dyskinesis being 
reliably related to shoulder injuries [^9] and so on.  

### The Sociopolitical Field
The trouble with this Dogmatic Image of Physiotherapy is that the larger systems (historical, political, and socioeconomic 
fields) upon which our particular representations are contingent are often neglected. Put another way, we bypass the 
historical and socio-political character of the existing categories of representation and perpetuate their unquestioned 
validity. When this occurs, the dominant Thought appears to simply reflect reality; we view it as a transcendent Truth 
that we can apply to the world at large.

>The specifically dogmatic character of the traditional image of thought can therefore be discerned in the manner in 
which acts of recognition are taken to be emblematic of what it means to think, acts of recognition that are dependent 
upon representational categories that, in order to be understood as simply naming or mirroring reality, are taken to be 
transcendent, transparent and self-evident categories rather than historical, socio-politically embedded constructions.
> — <cite>Roberts 2013[^10]</cite>

Crucially I want to draw attention to the dominant lens through which we view health, the biopsychosocial model. The 
taken-for-granted presuppositions might be the social, historical, economic, and politically contingent representational 
categories surrounding the biopsychosocial model. Clinicians wield the biopsychosocial model under the guise of “holistic 
care,” but often ignore its (or their) own enmeshment within a neoliberal socio-political field which stymies holistic 
care. Placing the onus of responsibility on our clients may seem like “common-sense” and self-evident. We might say “No 
one can deny that patients need to foster self-efficacy and less reliance on medical providers.” We think individual 
responsibility is empowering in all cases. However, this is deeply political and quite recent.

During his 1981 inaugural address, Ronald Reagan asked “if no-one among us is capable of governing himself, then who 
among us has the capacity to govern someone else?” With this statement, he outlined his complex political-economic agenda 
to shift responsibility from the state to the individual. These policies, mindsets, and cultural shifts have been further 
developed through the politics of Bill Clinton in the U.S. and Tony Blair in the U.K. The pervasive rhetoric of personal 
responsibility has altered the role of the government, whose primary role now is to facilitate the conditions in which 
citizens can take on more responsibility. By strongly focusing on the individual and by disregarding the importance of 
community and state, neoliberalism increases the importance of individuality while decreasing the importance of society 
or governance. Think of the messaging around climate change for example - politicians preach “stop buying straws!” while 
much less is said about the larger corporations which profit from the continual production of environmentally harmful 
products. Healthcare is not absolved of this rhetoric.

When left unchecked, the biopsychosocial model reduces all three domains (bio, psycho and social) to the responsibility 
of the individual and away from society, larger systems, and even clinicians. When we discuss the biological, we discuss 
it in the context of our clients’ ability to affect their biology through exercise and “compliance” with treatment. When 
we discuss psychology, we identify the individuals’ maladaptive psychological state (poor self-efficacy, fear avoidance 
behaviour, pain catastrophizing) and administer interventions which aim to assist them in realising and correcting their 
said psychological deficits or maladaption. Perhaps most tragic of all, when discussing the social domain, we haven’t a 
clue what we are doing. The best we can come up with is a limp attempt at discussing their social relationships and how 
they are socially supported. If we decide that their social support structure is not adequate, we make recommendations 
to the client on what they might consider doing to remedy the situation. God forbid you ask a physiotherapist to venture 
close to questions of economic security, discrimination, or acces to services or infrastructure [^11]. One of the overarching 
aims of healthcare is to hand the person’s health over to the individual and out of the hands of the state. Individual 
responsibility can be useful and important too, but it is a thin slice of the pie.

To assume the biopsychosocial model - or whatever model, treatment modality, or diagnostic label we were taught - represents 
a “Truth,” and not a reflection of the socio-political field we are steeped in would be remiss.

If the contingent historical and socio-political factors which construct the biopsychosocial model are elided, if its 
representational category is understood as transparent and self-evident, mirroring or reflecting the way in which health 
exists in the world and has been waiting to be discovered, then the biopsychosocial model, would largely be understood as 
uncontroversial and unproblematic. This is clearly not the case. We could say the same for many taken-for-granted concepts 
such as Pain Self-efficacy, Perceived Injustice, Postural Alignment, “pain as a response to threat”, and so on. We often come 
against the limitations of these Dogmas when we are dealing with the complexity of a patient, intersecting across a variety 
of social, economic, physiological, and psychological fields. When we treat these concepts as Dogmatic Images of Thought, we 
foster unreflective acceptance of existing categories and acts of recognition. This stifles our ability as clinicians and 
critical thinkers in the field.

>The form of recognition has never sanctioned anything but the recognisable and the recognised; form will never inspire 
anything but conformities.
> — <cite>Deleuze 1995[^2]</cite>

We can keep ourselves quite occupied negotiating and swapping out some “Truths” for better ones (i.e. the biopsychosocial 
over biomedicine; etc.) We might think we are trading one faulty representation of reality for a more accurate one, but what 
we are really trading is a complex set of beliefs contingent upon socio-political and historical factors which suit our particular 
worldview and cultural milieu of the time. 

When we take a step back from the profession, creating space between ourselves and the “painting” as it were, we can question 
what it was that we were looking at. We see the painting as a whole, situated in a context; the frame within which the painting 
sits, the wall on which the painting hangs, the building wherein the painting is kept, the people who have access to the building, 
and so on.  

### Critique and Resist
We might understand Deleuze’s critique of the Dogmatic Image of Thought as a warning against intellectual complacency or dogmatism. 
We cannot say that when we are engaged in an act of recognition, when we are engaged in “what everyone knows” that thinking is 
occurring. What of wonder and the sublime? What of the new and the things unthought? As Deleuze asked: “who can believe that the 
destiny of thought is at stake in these acts, and that when we recognise, we are thinking?” 

Thinking creatively and eliminating presuppositions at the starting point of thinking will move us beyond the bounds of the Dogmatic 
Image of Thought. Within physiotherapy, this means becoming aware of our profession’s predominant, favoured ways of thinking.

Once we have become aware of our go-to assumptions, how do we create new concepts or categories that liberate us from dogmatic thought? 

Deleuze suggests, “the conditions of a true critique and a true creation are the same: the destruction of an image of thought which 
presupposes itself and the genesis of the act of thinking in thought itself.”[^2]

It starts with an ongoing critique of the meaning of a given representational category that has gained predominance. We need to critically 
analyse our profession’s imobile categories and how they were constructed in response to a diversity of theoretical and practical problems 
that were deemed important to a particular historically embedded socio-political milieu [^11]. By reflecting upon the historical and 
socio-political function of the category, we seek to determine the value of the ongoing adherence to and employment of that category. 
Only on the backbone of this critique, can we start to experiment with these categories within the current historical and socio-political 
milieu. We might even creatively transform them by integrating new concepts into our practice, and curiously analyse what value each concept 
might have for the everyday concerns of the clinician. 

Deleuze’s work inspires a solution, a manner in which we escape the Dogmatic Image of Thought. When we are implicitly presented with the 
presupposition “as we all know…”, resist. Deleuze suggests that we should refuse to be represented as one of the everybody. Disallow others 
to speak on our behalf and instead say “I am not part of the big everybody”. All of what has been presupposed once again returns to 
philosophical scrutiny. This is where real thought can begin. When called to recognise, choose rather to re-cognise, think again, go deeper, 
look behind “common sense”.
