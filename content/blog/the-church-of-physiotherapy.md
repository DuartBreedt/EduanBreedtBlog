>We go toward the most unknown and the best unknown, this is what we are looking for when we write. 
We go toward the best known unknown thing, where knowing and not knowing touch, where we hope we 
will know what is unknown. Where we hope we will not be afraid of understanding the incomprehensible, 
facing invisible, hearing the inaudible, thinking the unthinkable, which is of course: thinking.
> — <cite>Hélène Cixous[^1]</cite>

This is an exercise in writing, not to be interpreted and understood, but to produce something which is 
affective. “... all mistranslations result in beauty. This is a good way to read: all mistranslations are 
good”[^2]. A staccato, “roughened” rhythm in writing removes automatism in thought, creates a 
straining in knowledge between what is known and not known: “a straining of one's whole language toward 
something outside it.”[^3] This is an attempt at bilingualism, a minor use of language, a 
stammering: “being like a foreigner in one's own language. Constructing a line of flight”[^2]. 
With enough resistance and friction, I hope “...a spark can flash and break out of language itself, to make 
us see and think what was lying in the shadow around the words, things we were hardly aware existed.”[^3] Nothing 
interesting begins with knowing, but with not knowing. This is an attempt to produce a little machine plugging 
into other little machines, in attempt to produce flows that can “...bring things to life, to free life from 
where it's trapped, to trace lines of flight. “[^3]

### Why Betray Physiotherapy?

Every field needs a bit of betrayal - a bit of Judas - if it desires to have movement[^4]. Complacency, conservatism, 
and dogmatism opposes change and the new. Writer Jorge Luis Borges imagined a Judas who he describes as intuiting 
the necessity of the divine plan and thus the crucifixion to incite a rebellion [^5]. He describes Judas as 
sacrificing his own reputation for the divine plan. God became fully incarnate, not through Jesus, but through Judas. 

My betrayal is an intentional repealment of my discipleship, no longer being a follower of Physiotherapy as it 
currently stands. However, this is not an act of hate but an act of love. I believe in physiotherapy. I believe 
it can be better. I believe that a new direction might lead to movement with greater potential. 

This critique elucidates the ethical and political reasons why radically cutting ties with a number of the 
philosophical underpinnings of the profession and becoming a traitor prophet might be necessary for physiotherapy.  

### The Evangelical Fundamentalist Physiotherapists

Believers in “Evidence-Based Practice” have discussed at length how a relatively sizable proportion of the 
profession practices using outdated modalities and rituals despite overwhelming evidence that many of these 
interventions are no better than placebo [^6]. Snakeoil Salesman. They insist “I see it work!” as they 
continue their faith healing. 

Thank you Plato! It is the ontological obsession with identity we take for granted which has led us to this 
cal de sac of thought. 

Posing motionless like physiotherapists, awkwardly holding a strained smile for a lifetime, waiting for God 
knows who to take our picture hoping we fill the empty frame. 

>Like Sartre’s Waiter with Bad Faith, we act inauthentically, by yielding to the external pressures of society 
to adopt false values and disown our own innate freedom as sentient human beings. As a physiotherapist our 
movements and conversation might be a little too “physio-esque”. Our voice oozes with an eagerness to inform, 
correct, and educate; we demonstrate exercises rigidly and ostentatiously; our movements a little too precise, 
a little too certain. It is a clear give away, our exaggerated behaviour illustrates that we are play acting 
as a physiotherapist, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a physiotherapist
> — <cite>See [^7]</cite>

Standing on their mound of meta-analysis, randomised control trials, and Cochrane reviews, the post-positivists 
point and laugh. “How narrow-minded!” they remark contemptuously: “if only they could question their own 
fundamental beliefs” [^8]. 

“Science is the Way to Truth!,” they prophecy. “We can all achieve enlightenment, just give up your sinful flesh, 
your false perceptions, your ways in the world, your biases, so that you can see clearly.”

Truth, pure Truth, is thought of as having asymptotic fidelity which we can approximate when we exorcise our sinful 
corporeal selves with the double-blind randomized controlled ritual. It will wash away our “faulty subjectivity” and 
lived experiences so we can get at “the things in themselves” (Ref Kant). Truth is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, 
all hail. 

How much easier would it be if humans stopped making the world filthy with their lived experiences, ugh.

[What comfortable narratives or emotions did you notice coming up for you while you were reading this section?]  

### A New King

We constructed a hierarchy, an ontology of transcendence, and rendered ourselves subordinate to God who we placed 
on an imaginary throne. Having become enlightened, now a scientific people, we thought God a figure much too archaic
and primitive for our taste. We overthrew the king but left the phantasm of the throne. Once empty, Truth crept onto 
the already warm comfortable seat. So familiar and recognisable, we let Truth stay. 

Although the symbols have changed, our underlying ontology (belief apparatus) has remained much the same. 

We cannot escape our religious history. Scientism is the new Being of God. With enough inquiry we will eventually 
discover how things are in themselves it insists. Through our ontology of being, we view Truth, Morality, and Justice 
as eternal, unchanging, and objective; out there somewhere and merely needing to be uncovered. 

The evidence-based practice denomination and their essentialist agenda asks “what are human bodies actually and 
essentially like?” bringing with it assumptions that there exists a normal and ideal body we ought to strive for. 
Healthcare providers have the power to be the arbiters of bodies and minds. We sort the ideal from the non-ideal. 
The normal from the abnormal. The compliant from the deviant. The Christ-like from the not Christ-like. 

We’re told we can know the world if we granulate it and study its little bits. Bodies and their bits. We can fix it 
once we find out where the screw fell out. To stop and measure, we need a world that stands still and we need concept 
which can hold the world. But concepts solidify reality; they fix between rigid outlines like a camera freezes reality 
on the surface of the paper. To define is to confine. Concepts deform reality; reality, in its continuous movement, is 
richer than any concept.  To quantify we need to create immobilities of the fundamentally mobile. We solidify flows 
(ref Bergson creative evolution). Quantum theory exemplified that when we ask wave-like questions we get wave-like 
answers and when we ask particle-like questions we get particle-like answers. 

Very pragmatic indeed but we need to acknowledge immobilities where they exist. But devoted to our “models of health,” 
we are sat gnawing on the menu - having mistaken it for the meal. 

This is our prerogative - qualifying the qualitative. We all swim in the waters of post-positivism, but no one knows 
they are wet. The same form, different content. Verifiability, falsification, and replicability are the new commandments 
and Cochrane reviews are the books of the bible. We follow our Messiah, Evidence-based Practice, he will lead us to Truth 
and it is only in Truth that we can ever be whole. From John 8:32 to John et al, 2008. As long as there is an ontology of 
Being and transcendence, every generation will have its religion. 

Atheism is not so different from theism. It is a matter of preference for a God Being or a Truth Being. 

God's not dead, he wears a different crown (ref FN). 

Author’s note:
I feel compelled to defend myself and explain that I am not “anti-science”. (Why do I feel compelled to assure you I am not 
“anti-science”? What repercussions do I fear? Is this what self-regulation looks like? The panopticon perhaps Mr. Foucault? (ref)). 
What I am, however, is anti-fascist. Evidence-based medicine has a pernicious kind of micro-fascism that holds us captive 
(ref Dave Holmes). But I guess that is the nature of the beast. Categories and identities make us comfortable. If a reader has already 
designated a label for me, there is little I can do about it.

[Did you notice a feeling of unease? Why? Where might that be coming from?]  

### Enough of Socrates!

We dehydrated and dissected the body and embalmed it with the physiotherapy “regime of truth” (ref Foucault). This taxidermied 
body did not sit well with those still living so we responded with “person-centered care”. But, person-centered care is a trojan 
horse that also infiltrates patients with the physiotherapy agenda. 

If we obtain “buy-in”, if we lead the proverbial horse to water, maybe they will drink the stupefacient. We need to listen, foster 
trust, empathy, and care, so that we can lovingly show them the Truth. Educate them into submission. Tender fascism. “But hey, you 
win some and you lose some. You can’t fix everyone. They might come back in a few years with greater readiness for change.” 

Love the sinner, not the sin! 

Our words percolate through the husk of the person whom the dogmatic image of physiotherapy has emptied out. We now provide only 
that which benefits the profession: sick bodies and healthy bodies, predictability and conformity. Like Dr Ioannidis I am curious to 
know if evidence based practice will continue to lead “to more medicine, even if this means less health?” Ref (Hijack article)

As it stands, physiotherapy does not disturb thought. It keeps us very busy engaging our faculties in activities that refer back 
to objects of recognition (diff and rep). Thought is filled with no more than an image of itself and its own internal logic, it 
recognises itself the more it recognises things (diff and rep ref). 

Deleuze insists that conformism of thought wed to representation and recognition has left us virtually no tools to break with that 
which everyone already knows. (wallin ref) 

“The exercise of thought thus conforms to the … dominant meanings and to the requirements of the established order.” 
https://blogit.utu.fi/landd/2020/01/10/the-double-theft/ Physiotherapy thinks for physiotherapists. It gives us norms, rules, 
and complicity. An image of thought.

### An Immanant Creator

A creator who is the same, creating nothing new, is no creator at all. The truly creative Creator is never the same but always 
different. Not transcendent, but immanent. A theology of radical inclusion of difference, not the exclusion of difference. To 
affirm difference is to affirm life.

>To affirm is not to bear, carry, or harness oneself to that which exists, but on the contrary to unburden, unharness, and set 
free that which lives
> — <cite>Gilles Deeluze[^1]</cite>

After all, it was Paul who in a moment of lucidity denied an ontology of identity (transcendence) for one of difference (immanence) 
allowing the possibility for the “new”: “Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self [transcendence] with its 
practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator [Difference in itself]. 
Here there is no [identity] Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ [Difference] 
is all, and is in all.” [^1](author added in brackets)  

### Making the Familiar Strange

>Habitualization devours objects, clothes, furniture, one's wife, and the fear of war. . . Art exists to help us recover the sensation 
of life, it exists to make us feel things, to make the stone stony. The end of art is to give a sensation of the object as seen, not as 
recognized. The technique of art is to make things 'unfamiliar,' to make forms obscure, so as to increase the difficulty and duration of 
perception. 
> — <cite>Viktor Schklovsky</cite>

Poets, writers, and painters aren’t artists, have the potential to be opticians. They help us see things as they are sensed and not as they 
are known (recognised). We are forced to look again, to see for the first time, from the outside (ref outsider music).  “Seeing”, in this sense 
“is forgetting the name of the thing one sees.” (ref book)

Sometimes we need an optician to lead us by the hand out of the village into terra nulius, outside the city walls (ref outsider music). What if 
“there's something wrong in the village”? (ref Wrabel village) This is the function of the last guru: to reveal not their universal perspective, 
but the absence of a universal perspective.

>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, 
“Do you see anything?” 
> — <cite>Mark 8:23 (NIV)[^1]</cite>

Now outside the city gates -  between territories - we are provided a perspective that was not afforded to us when we were complicit with the 
order of things. Becoming nomadic, becoming Moses (a stammerer) - having a small plot of new land at all times” (ref Deleuze). If we go to 
“the far side of the wilderness” we encounter the “strange” (ref Exodus 3:1-3), even if only for a moment. This is the value of getting lost 
and not knowing where to go. 

>To move from A to B, we have to go from A to not A. We do not go from certainty to certainty, but from certainty to uncertainty, from stability 
to instability.
> — <cite>[^1]</cite>

Betray comfort -  break the boundaries of a thing to create new limits and explore alternatives previously hidden by the city walls. Enter the 
transitional space between thought and unthought, not knowing what might appear, not knowing what to do next, like eyes before they open (ref every colour). 
The liminal spaces allow us to find new becomings. An ethics of betrayal demands a radical movement away from our faculties of memory, and 
reflection, rejecting the comfort of the status quo (ref Wallin).

>The conditions of a true critique and a true creation are the same: the destruction of an image of thought which presupposes itself and the 
genesis of the act of thinking in thought itself
> — <cite>Gilles Deleuze[^1]</cite>

What we need is “something in the world” to force us to think, not the recognisable (that which can be recalled, imagined, or conceived) but a 
“fundamental encounter” (ref diff and rep). We require an outside thought which violates (an image of) thought that attempts to think on our 
behalf (ref wallin). Thinking takes place out of reach of physiotherapy’s agenda. What forces us to think is imperceptible to “the physiotherapist” 
and is only available to the traitor prophet if they choose it: “the truth is not revealed, it is betrayed” (Proust and signs). So that we might 
become “...someone - if only one-with the necessary modesty [of] not managing to know what everybody knows, and modestly denying what everybody 
is supposed to recognise. Someone who neither allows himself to be represented nor wishes to represent anything” (ref Deleuze diff and rep).

>Thinking is trying to think the unthinkable: thinking the thinkable is not worth the effort
> — <cite>Hélène Cixous[^1]</cite>

Looking at physiotherapy long and hard enough allows it to recede and lose meaning. What was once familiar (physiotherapy) is now strange. 
The name is the same, but its character warps and becomes dissonant the further we walk from the city walls. The word is now charged as if 
it both hungers for what it was and anticipates what it might become - a strange pulsing of both past and present. Bodies that were and 
bodies yet to come. Physiotherapists that were and physiotherapists that are yet to come. There is another world out there we don’t know - beyond the recognizable.

“Do you see anything [new]”? (ref Mark 8:23 (NIV))
