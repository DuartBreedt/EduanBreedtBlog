I remain intellectually mobile, I am unable to sediment my thoughts. Change proves to be my only constant. Putting words to my thoughts, for a moment it feels right, in focus, before it feels incredibly wrong. So I start again and I say something different.

This space is my cemetery for the incredibly wrong and where I affirm difference. This is where I ravel.
