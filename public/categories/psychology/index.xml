      <description>French philosopher Gilles Deleuze&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of active forces and reactive forces has helped me with these questions - and come up with more.
In his reading of Nietchze, Deleuze speaks of how history unfolds through active and reactive forces.
An active force is one which creates. Todd May would say &amp;ldquo;It follows its own path; it does what it does&amp;rdquo;. What it creates allows new ways of being to emerge. It does not seek to destroy but may destroy as a result of its creation in the world.</description>
